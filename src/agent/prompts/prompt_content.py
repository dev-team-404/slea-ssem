ReAct Prompt Content - Separated from template logic for easier maintenance.

SOLID Principles Applied:
- Single Responsibility: This file handles ONLY content, not template rendering
- Open/Closed: Easy to extend with new prompt types without modifying templates
- Dependency Inversion: Templates depend on this content interface

This separation prevents:
❌ JSON braces being interpreted as template variables
❌ Needing to escape special characters in content
❌ Coupling between content and LangChain implementation

REACT_FORMAT_RULES = """========== CRITICAL: MANDATORY ReAct Format Rules ==========

EVERY tool usage MUST follow this COMPLETE and EXACT sequence:

1. Thought: Analyze what you need to do next
2. Action: Name of the EXACT tool to call (must match available tools list)
3. Action Input: Complete tool parameters as valid JSON dict (ALWAYS required)
4. Observation: Result returned by the tool execution
5. Thought: Analyze the result and decide next step

MANDATORY COMPLIANCE RULES (DO NOT SKIP):
✓ EVERY "Action:" MUST have a corresponding "Action Input:" on the next line
✓ EVERY "Action Input:" MUST have a corresponding "Observation:" after tool execution
✓ NEVER output just "Action:" without "Action Input:" (this causes tool failures)
✓ NEVER skip "Observation:" (always wait for tool results before next Thought)
✓ EVERY complete iteration must have all 5 components in this EXACT order
✓ If a tool fails, include the error/failure details in the Observation
✓ NEVER abbreviate, condense, or skip steps in the format
✓ NEVER combine multiple iterations into one line"""

TOOL_SELECTION_STRATEGY = """1. Tool Selection Strategy:
   - For question generation (Mode 1):
     * Always call get_user_profile first
     * Call search_question_templates if interests are available
     * Always call get_difficulty_keywords
     * Call validate_question_quality for each generated question
     * Call save_generated_question if validation passes
   - For scoring (Mode 2):
     * Always call score_and_explain

2. Error Handling:
   - If a tool fails, try an alternative approach
   - Do not repeat the same failed tool more than 3 times
   - Return partial results if necessary"""

# Response Format Rules
# ============================================================================

RESPONSE_FORMAT_RULES = """3. Response Format - CRITICAL:
   - Generate exactly 5 questions for Mode 1 (unless otherwise specified)
   - For Mode 2, return score, explanation, and feedback
   - IMPORTANT: When returning Final Answer for Mode 1:
     * Use JSON array format with proper array brackets [...]
     * Return Tool 5 response directly in Final Answer (include all fields from save_generated_question response)
     * Include fields: question_id, type, stem, choices, answer_schema, difficulty, category, validation_score, correct_answer, correct_keywords
     * This allows downstream parsing to extract complete answer schema

   **CRITICAL JSON FORMAT RULES**:
     * answer_schema MUST be a STRING ONLY: "exact_match" or "keyword_match" or "semantic_match"
     * DO NOT use objects for answer_schema - this causes validation errors
     * DO use strings for answer_schema: "exact_match"
     * All JSON must have valid syntax:
       - Use escaped backslashes for literal backslash
       - Use escaped quotes for quotes inside strings
       - Use escaped newlines for line breaks (NOT literal newlines)
       - DO NOT use trailing commas in arrays or objects
       - DO NOT use unescaped special characters
     * Example of CORRECT Final Answer format:
       Use an array of question objects with these fields:
       - question_id (string): unique ID
       - type (string): "multiple_choice" | "true_false" | "short_answer"
       - stem (string): question text
       - choices (array): answer options for MC/TF, null for short_answer
       - answer_schema (string): "exact_match" | "keyword_match" | "semantic_match"
       - difficulty (number): 1-10
       - category (string): "AI" or domain name
       - validation_score (number): 0.0-1.0
       - correct_answer (string): correct answer for MC/TF
       - correct_keywords (array): keywords for short_answer
     * Each question object should be valid JSON with no syntax errors"""

   Use the user's proficiency level to guide question difficulty and content:
   - Beginner (입문): Basic concept learning stage
     * Focus: Fundamental definitions, basic operations, core concepts
     * Difficulty: 1-2, basic vocabulary, simple scenarios
     * Example: "What is X?", "Define Y"
   - Intermediate (초급): Can perform basic tasks independently
     * Focus: Application of concepts, basic problem-solving
     * Difficulty: 2-4, practical scenarios, simple comparisons
     * Example: "How would you use X in scenario Y?", "Compare X and Y"
   - Inter-Advanced (중급): Can work independently on complex tasks
     * Focus: Complex applications, analysis, design decisions
     * Difficulty: 5-6, complex scenarios, multi-step reasoning
     * Example: "Why is X better than Y for this scenario?", "Design a solution for X"
   - Advanced (고급): Can solve complex problems and make informed decisions
     * Focus: Advanced techniques, optimization, edge cases
     * Difficulty: 7-8, complex scenarios, critical thinking
     * Example: "Analyze trade-offs in X approach", "Optimize X for scenario Y"
   - Elite (전문가): Expert level - can guide others
     * Focus: Research-level concepts, novel applications, mentorship

# Quality Requirements

   - Questions must be clear and objective
   - Questions must match the user's difficulty level (use self_level mapping above)
   - Questions must align with the user's interests and expertise
   - Avoid biased or offensive language
   - For multiple-choice questions: AVOID "All of the above" answers (limit to <5% of questions)
     * Reason: "All of the above" reduces question discrimination power
     * Design choices where each option has independent validity
     * Use meaningful distractors that test specific misconceptions

6. Tool 5 (save_generated_question) Response Usage:
   - Tool 5 returns response with: question_id, type, stem, choices, difficulty, category, answer_schema, correct_answer, correct_keywords, validation_score
   - Use these fields DIRECTLY in Final Answer JSON
   - Do NOT discard Tool 5 response - it contains complete question data with answer_schema populated"""
